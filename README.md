###***WARNING:*** This project is no longer actively maintained - use at your own risk!

It was built upon ixagon's SurfaceMapper library, which was abandoned shortly after the release of this project. This repository is made available mainly for educational and illustrative purposes, and it is recommended that other approaches be explored if you need to do some real-world projection mapping.

Particularly, check out [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) and its various projection mapping addons available through http://ofxaddons.com (ofx2DMapping, ofxPiMapper and others)

## SurfaceMapperGUI

Projection mapping interface using Processing's SurfaceMapper library and ControlP5 libraries

### Features
1. Create new surfaces (straight-edged quads or curved-edged bezier surfaces).
2. Load and save layouts.
3. Switch back and forth between rendering and calibrating.
4. Alter the resolution of the surfaces.
5. Alter the horizontal and vertical “force” on the edges of bezier surfaces.
6. Anchor points that are moved close to each other will snap together.
7. Assign pictures or videos as textures to any surface.
